What am I doing? 

# This is dumb simple. Go forward.

Ok. Ok. ok.

let me just write down my thoughts one by one

- 1) ask user where will they be visiting
- 2) ask user who they are
- 3) ask user for year of graduation / letter of their class

- 3.1) validate their input manually or against our records.
- 3.2) if not found -> ask if they changed their name / clarify 
- 3.3) 

- Can I do a simple table from our end - year of graduation + class letter + name
